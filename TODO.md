# TODO: BizList API

This file outlines the tasks required to build the backend API for the BizList project. The API will be consumed by a separate Next.js/React frontend.  This TODO list prioritizes building a functional core before adding user authentication.

## I. API Infrastructure

- [ ] **Framework Selection:**
  - [ ] Choose an API framework (e.g., FastAPI (Python), Node.js with Express).  Consider factors like ease of use, performance, and community support.
- [ ] **Project Setup:**
  - [ ] Create project directory and initialize Git repository.
  - [ ] Install necessary dependencies.
- [ ] **API Endpoint Structure:**
  - [ ] Design the basic structure of API endpoints (URLs, HTTP methods).
- [ ] **Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Implement a robust error handling mechanism (HTTP status codes, custom error responses).
- [ ] **Logging:**
  - [ ] Set up logging to track API requests, responses, and errors.
- [ ] **Configuration:**
  - [ ] Implement configuration management (environment variables, config files).  Consider using a library like `python-dotenv` (Python) or similar.
- [ ] **Testing Framework:**
  - [ ] Set up a testing framework (e.g., pytest (Python), Jest (Node.js)).

## II. Contact Search API

- [ ] **Data Sources Integration:**
  - [ ] **LinkedIn API:**  Investigate LinkedIn API access and limitations (rate limits, API keys).
  - [ ] **Crunchbase API:** Investigate Crunchbase API access and limitations (rate limits, API keys).
  - [ ] **ZoomInfo API:** Investigate ZoomInfo API access and limitations (rate limits, API keys).
  - [ ] **Company Website Scraping:** Design a robust web scraping strategy (consider libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy, handling robots.txt, and ethical scraping practices).
  - [ ] **Industry Association Directories:** Identify and plan integration with relevant industry directories (APIs or web scraping).
- [ ] **Data Extraction & Processing:**
  - [ ] Implement data extraction logic for each data source, handling inconsistencies and errors.
  - [ ] Normalize extracted data into a consistent format.
  - [ ] Implement data cleaning (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing data).
- [ ] **Data Storage:**
  - [ ] Choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
  - [ ] Design the database schema for storing contacts (consider indexing for efficient searching).
- [ ] **Search Endpoint Implementation:**
  - [ ] Implement the main search endpoint (POST request with JSON payload).
  - [ ] Define request parameters (keywords, industry, job title, location, company size, etc.).
  - [ ] Define response format (JSON with contact details, pagination metadata).
- [ ] **Filtering & Sorting:**
  - [ ] Implement filtering based on request parameters.
  - [ ] Implement sorting of results.
- [ ] **Pagination:**
  - [ ] Implement pagination to handle large result sets efficiently.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting:**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- [ ] **Testing (Search API):**
  - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for the search endpoint.

## III. Security

- [ ] **Input Validation:**
  - [ ] Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
- [ ] **Output Sanitization:**
  - [ ] Sanitize output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting (Enhanced):**
  - [ ] Refine rate limiting based on testing and usage patterns.
- [ ] **Dependency Security:**
  - [ ] Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Secrets Management:**
  - [ ] Securely store and manage API keys and database credentials (environment variables, secrets management services).

## IV. User Management & Authentication (After Core Functionality)

- [ ] **Authentication:**
  - [ ] Implement user registration (email/password).
  - [ ] Implement user login (email/password).
  - [ ] Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
  - [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism.
  - [ ] Implement password reset functionality.
  - [ ] Implement user logout.
- [ ] **Authorization:**
  - [ ] Define user roles (e.g., admin, user).
  - [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for API endpoints.
- [ ] **User Profile:**
  - [ ] Create endpoints to get and update user profile information.
- [ ] **Testing (User Management):**
  - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for user management features.

## V. API Documentation & Deployment

- [ ] **API Documentation:**
  - [ ] Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
- [ ] **Deployment:**
  - [ ] Choose a deployment platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud).
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline.

## VI. Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Data Enrichment:** Integrate with data enrichment services.
- [ ] **Advanced Search:** Implement more advanced search features.
- [ ] **Contact Management:** Allow users to save and manage contacts.
- [ ] **Analytics:** Track API usage and provide analytics.
- [ ] **Webhooks:** Implement webhooks for real-time notifications.
